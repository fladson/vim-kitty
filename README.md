    <i>Syntax highlighting for Kitty terminal config files for Vim and
        Neovim.</i>
</p>

## üìú Filetype detection

Any `*.conf` or `*.session` files in kitty's configuration directory is
considered.

You can always add `# vim:ft=kitty` at the beginning of any file to make sure
the syntax is loaded, or you can set it temporarily with `:set ft=kitty`.

## üöÄ Installation

### [lazy.nvim](https://lazy.folke.io/)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Lazy.nvim only works in Neovim and is the recommended method for it.

```lua
{
    "warbacon/vim-kitty",
    ft = "kitty",
}
```

### [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

> [!NOTE]
> Recommended method for Vim. Also works in Neovim but this is **Vimscript**.

```vim
Plug "warbacon/vim-kitty"
```

## ‚ùì Extra

Keywords based on `v0.36.2`. The `gen-syntax.py` script syncs keywords with
your current Kitty version, check inside of it for instructions.

This is a fork of the [fladson plugin](https://github.com/fladson/vim-kitty)
which is intended to be always in sync with the latest version of Kitty and may
introduce some improvements in the future.
